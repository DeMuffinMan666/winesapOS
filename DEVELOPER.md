## Drivers

### Mac

These drivers are provided for better compatibility with the lastest Macs with Intel processors:

- **apple-bce = T2 driver** required for storage, mouse, keyboard, and audio support. We provide a [git repository](https://github.com/LukeShortCloud/mbp2018-bridge-drv/tree/mac-linux-gaming-stick) that syncs up both the [t2linux](https://github.com/t2linux/apple-bce-drv) and [macrosfad](https://github.com/marcosfad/mbp2018-bridge-drv) forks. It provides the newer kernel compatibility from t2linux and also a DKMS module from macrosfad for easily installing the kernel driver.
- **macbook12-spi-driver-dkms = MacBook Pro Touch Bar driver.** The package is installed from the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/macbook12-spi-driver-dkms/).
- **snd_hda_macbookpro = Sound driver.** This requires the **apple-bce** driver to work on some Macs. We provide a [git repository](https://github.com/LukeShortCloud/snd_hda_macbookpro/tree/mac-linux-gaming-stick) that modifies the installation script to install for all Linux kernels found on the system instead of just the running Linux kernel.

## Files

These are a list of custom files and script that we install as part of winesapOS:

- `/etc/pacman.conf` = On SteamOS builds, this provides the correct order of enabled repositories. `[jupiter]` and `[holo]` come first and have package signatures disabled (Valve does not provide any). Then the Arch Linux repositories.
    - Source: `files/etc-pacman.conf_steamos`
- `/etc/snapper/configs/{root,home}` = The Snapper configuration for Btrfs backups.
    - Source: `files/etc-snapper-configs-root`
- `/etc/systemd/user/winesapos-mute.service` = A user (not system) service for muting all audio. This is required for some newer Macs that have in-development hardware drivers that are extremely loud by default.
    - Source: `files/winesapos-mute.service`
- `/usr/local/bin/winesapos-mute.sh` = The script for the winesapos-mute.service.
    - Source: `scripts/winesapos-mute.sh`
- `/etc/systemd/system/pacman-mirrors.service` = On Manjaro builds, this provides a service to find and configure the fastest mirrors for Pacman. This is not needed on Arch Linux builds as it has a Reflector service that comes with a service file. It is also not needed on SteamOS builds as Valve provides a CDN for their single mirror.
    - Source: `files/pacman-mirrors.service`
- `/etc/systemd/system/resize-root-file-system.service` = A service that runs a script to resize the root file system upon first boot.
    - Source: `resize-root-file-system.service`
- `/etc/systemd/system/winesapos-touch-bar-usbmuxd-fix.service` = A workaround for MacBook Pros with a Touch Bar. This will allow iOS devices to connect on Linux again. This service will show an error during boot if winesapOS boots on a system that is not a Mac with a Touch Bar.
    - Source: `files/winesapos-touch-bar-usbmuxd-fix.service`
- `/usr/local/bin/winesapos-touch-bar-usbmuxd-fix.sh` = The script used for the winesapos-touch-bar-usbmuxd-fix.service.
    - Source: `files/winesapos-touch-bar-usbmuxd-fix.sh`
- `/usr/share/libalpm/hooks/steamdeck-kde-presets.hook` = A Pacman hook that is triggered when the `steamdeck-kde-presets` package is installed or updated. This will delete a global autostart Steam desktop shortcut as our users may not want Steam to start immediately after login.
    - Source: `files/steamdeck-kde-presets.hook`
- `/home/winesap/.winesapos/winesapos-setup.desktop` = A desktop shortcut for the winesapOS First-Time Setup wizard.
    - Source: `files/winesapos-setup.desktop`
- `/home/winesap/.winesapos/winesapos-upgrade.desktop` = A desktop shortcut for the winesapOS Upgrade wizard.
    - Source: `files/winesapos-upgrade.desktop`
- `/usr/local/bin/resize-root-file-system.sh` = The script used for the resize-root-file-system.service.
    - Source: `scripts/resize-root-file-system.sh`
- `/home/winesap/.winesapos/winesapos-setup.sh` = The script used for the winesapOS First-Time Setup wizard.
    - Source: `scripts/winesapos-setup.sh`
- `/home/winesap/.winesapos/winesapos_logo_icon.png` = The winesapOS logo as a 96x96 icon for the winesapOS First-Time Setup and winesapOS Upgrade desktop shortcuts.
    - Source: `files/winesapos_logo_icon.png`
- `/home/winesap/.winesapos/winesapos-upgrade-remote-stable.sh` = The script used for the winesapOS Upgrade wizard. It pulls the latest upgrade script from the "stable" branch of winesapOS.
    - Source: `scripts/winesapos-upgrade-remote-stable.sh`
- `/home/winesap/Desktop/README.txt` = A read me file on the desktop that links to the GitHub page of winesapOS, explains the winesapOS wizards, and lists out all application shortcuts found on the desktop and what they are for.
    - Source: created as part of `scripts/winesapos-install.sh`

## Build

### Download the Installer

Depending on which Arch Linux distribution you want to build, download the related installer. Both Arch Linux and Manjaro provide ISOs for a live CD environment. The Steam Deck recovery image is a block device so it needs to be configured differently in a virtual machine before installing winesapOS.

- [Arch Linux ISO](https://archlinux.org/download/)
- [Manjaro KDE Plasma ISO](https://manjaro.org/downloads/official/kde/)
- [Steam Deck Recovery Image (for SteamOS 3)](https://store.steampowered.com/steamos/download/?ver=steamdeck&snr=) (default)

### Create Virtual Machine

A virtual machine is used to build winesapOS in a safe and isolated manner. The disks on the hypervisor will not be touched. It is assumed that QEMU/KVM will be used although other hypervisors can be used.

Requirements:

- UEFI boot
- 2 vCPUs
- 4 GB RAM
- 28 GiB storage (to fit on a 32 GB flash drive)

#### CLI

- Create the virtual storage device.

    - All:

    ```
    $ sudo qemu-img create -f raw -o size=28G /var/lib/libvirt/images/winesapos.img
    ```

- Create the virtual machine to use for installing winesapOS.

    - SteamOS 3 uses a recovery image.

    ```
    $ sudo virt-install --name winesapos --boot uefi --vcpus 2 --memory 4096 --disk path=/var/lib/libvirt/images/steamdeck-recovery-1.img,bus=virtio,cache=none --disk path=/var/lib/libvirt/images/winesapos.img,bus=virtio,cache=none
    ```

    - Arch Linux and Manjaro use an installer ISO image.

    ```
    $ sudo virt-install --name winesapos --boot uefi --vcpus 2 --memory 4096 --disk path=/var/lib/libvirt/images/winesapos.img,bus=virtio,cache=none --cdrom=/var/lib/libvirt/images/<INSTALLER_ISO>

### Environment Variables

For specialized builds, use environment variables to modify the installation settings.

```
$ export <KEY>=<VALUE>

### Install winesapOS

Once the virtual machine is running, a distribution of Arch Linux for winesapOS can be installed. An automated script is provided to fully install the operating system. This script will only work in a virtual machine. Clone the entire project repository. This will provide additional files and scripts that will be copied into the virtual machine image.

SteamOS 3 requires making the root file system writable, setting up Pacman keyrings for Arch Linux, and then installing required dependency.

```
$ sudo steamos-readonly disable
$ sudo pacman -S -y
$ sudo pacman-key --init
$ sudo pacman-key --populate archlinux
$ sudo pacman -S zsh
```

Arch Linux and Manjaro require installing dependencies.

```
$ sudo pacman -S -y
$ sudo pacman -S git
```

Clone the GitHub repository:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/lukeshortcloud/winesapos.git
$ cd winesapos/scripts/
```

Before running the installation script, optionally set environment variables to configure the build. Use `sudo -E` to load the environment variables.

- Performance focused image build:

    - SteamOS 3 (default):

        ```
        $ export WINESAPOS_DEVICE=vdb
        $ sudo -E ./winesapos-install.sh
        ```

    - Arch Linux:

        ```
        # export WINESAPOS_DISTRO=arch
        # ./winesapos-install.sh
        ```

    - Manjaro:

        ```
        $ export WINESAPOS_DISTRO=manjaro
        $ sudo -E ./winesapos-install.sh
        ```

- Secure focused image build requires first sourcing the environment variables:

    - SteamOS 3:

        ```
        $ export WINESAPOS_DEVICE=vdb
        $ . ./winesapos-env-secure.sh
        $ sudo -E ./winesapos-install.sh
        ```

    - Arch Linux:

        ```
        # export WINESAPOS_DISTRO=arch
        # . ./winesapos-env-secure.sh
        # ./winesapos-install.sh
        ```

    - Manjaro:

        ```
        $ export WINESAPOS_DISTRO=manjaro
        $ . ./winesapos-env-secure.sh
        $ sudo -E ./winesapos-install.sh
        ```

When complete, run the automated tests and then shutdown the virtual machine (do NOT restart). The image can then be cleaned up and used for manual testing on an external storage device.

### Tests

#### Automatic

Run the tests to ensure that everything was setup correctly. These are automatically ran and logged as part of the install script. The tests must be run with the ZSH shell (not BASH).

```
$ sudo zsh ./winesapos-tests.sh
```

#### Manual

On the hypervisor, clean up the virtual machine image. This will ensure that the image will generated unique values for additional security and stability. The `customize` operation is disabled because the operation will set a new machine-id which is not what we want. Our image already has a blank `/etc/machine-id` file which will be automatically re-generated on first boot.

```
$ sudo virt-sysprep --operations defaults,-customize -a /var/lib/libvirt/images/winesapos.img
```

Install the image onto an external storage device for testing.

```
$ sudo dd if=/var/lib/libvirt/images/winesapos.img of=/dev/<DEVICE>
```

## Workflows

### Adding Applications

If adding a new application to winesapOS, these are all of the places it needs to be updated:

- `README.md` needs to mention that application under the "Usability" or "Gaming support" sections under the "Features" header.
- `CHANGELOG.md` needs to mention that the application has has been `Add`ed, `Change`d, or `Remove`d.
- `src/winesapos-install.sh`
    - The installer creates a file at "/home/winesap/Desktop/README.txt" that lists every GUI applications.
    - The installer creates shortcut files for GUI applications.
- `src/winesapos-tests.sh` needs updated tests to at least check for the existence of the package and desktop shortcut (if applicable).

## Release

1. For a new release, update the `VERSION` file in the git repository with the new version before building an image.
2. After a build, make sure that no tests are failing.

    ```
    $ grep "FAIL" /winesapos/etc/winesapos/winesapos-install.log
    ```

3. On the hypervisor, stop the virtual machine and then sanitize the image.

    ```
    $ sudo virt-sysprep --operations defaults,-customize -a /var/lib/libvirt/images/winesapos.img
    ```

4. Create a release by using the universal `zip` compression utility. Using `zip` also allows for splitting the archive into 2 GiB parts which is required for uploading a GitHub release. Do this for both a build of the "performance" (default) and "secure" images.

    ```
    $ cd /var/lib/libvirt/images/
    $ sudo mv winesapos.img winesapos-[performance|secure]-<VERSION>.img
    $ sudo zip -s 1900m winesapos-[performance|secure]-<VERSION>.img.zip winesapos-[performance|secure]-<VERSION>.img
    $ ls -1 | grep winesapos
    winesapos-[performance|secure]-<VERSION>.img
    winesapos-[performance|secure]-<VERSION>.img.z01
    winesapos-[performance|secure]-<VERSION>.img.z02
    winesapos-[performance|secure]-<VERSION>.img.zip
    ```

5. Create SHA512 checkums separately for both the performance and secure image and their related archive files. Users can then use those files to check for corruption or tampering.

    ```
    $ sha512sum winesapos-performance* > winesapos-performance-<VERSION>_sha512sum.txt
    $ sha512sum winesapos-secure* > winesapos-secure-<VERSION>_sha512sum.txt
    $ sha512sum --check winesapos-performance-<VERSION>_sha512sum.txt
    $ sha512sum --check winesapos-secure-<VERSION>_sha512sum.txt
    ```
6. Create a git tag and push it.

    ```
    $ git tag X.Y.Z
    $ git push origin X.Y.Z
    ```
    
7. Sync the stable branch with the latest tag. This is required for the upgrade script. Old versions of winesapOS will pull the latest upgrade script from the stable branch.

    ```
    $ git checkout stable
    $ git rebase X.Y.Z
    $ git push origin stable
    ```
